#Step One - Data Set

#Step Two - Get Organized

creating a single folder 
    The RMD file that contains the analysis, final plots and summary, and reflection is the last section in the RMD file.
    The HTML file 
    Data processing or transformations (creating a categorical variable) should be included in the RMD file and the final knitted HTML output.
    The data set 

#Step Three - Explore your Data (refer to the Example Project)

apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

    avoid: Inappropriate plots are chosen for data in the Final Plots section.

#Step Four - Document your Analysis formatted in markdown:

    A stream-of-consciousness analysis and exploration of the data.
    a. Headings and text should organize your thoughts and reflect your 
    analysis as you explored the data.
    b. Plots in this analysis do not need to be polished with labels, 
    units, and titles; these plots are exploratory 
    c. You can iterate on a plot in the same R chunk, but you don’t 
    need to show every plot iteration in your analysis.
    d. Each plot should also contain a caption or description about 
    what the plot shows.

    A section at the end called “Final Plots and Summary”:
    select three plots from analysis to polish and share, showing different 
    trends and should be polished with appropriate labels, units, and titles, 
    giving insight into the data set that you investigated.
    three strong plots consulted with the document, Creating Effective Plots.

    Avoid: plots in the Final Plots section do not reveal a finding or 
    pattern in the data set. Final Plots are not polished and are missing 
    titles or units.
    


    A final section called “Reflection”:
    struggles, successes, and ideas for future exploration on the data set 

#Step Five - Knit your RMD file: 
contain text and plots interspersed throughout. 

#Step Six - Document your Data: 
The data set you submit hould include a text file describes the source and an explanation of the variables in the data set (definition of any variables, units, levels of categorical variables, and the data generating process, such as how data was collected if possible).
